# 🏠 **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices based on the famous **Boston Housing Dataset**.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can be used to predict house prices by learning the relationship between features like crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, and more.

---

## 🔍 **Dataset Used**

The **Boston Housing Dataset**, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service about housing in the Boston area.  
It includes **506 rows** and **13 features** such as:

- CRIM: Crime rate by town
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town  
... and others.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **scikit-learn** (for model building)

---

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**

- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- **Steps:**
  1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  3. Feature Selection
  4. Train/Test Split
  5. Model Training
  6. Evaluation (using R² score, MAE, MSE, RMSE)

---

## 📈 **Model Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using:

- 🔹 **R² Score**
- 🔹 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- 🔹 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- 🔹 **Root Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

You can visualize residuals and actual vs predicted values using the plots in the notebook.
